PROPOSAL:

Deck of Cards API – 21 game variation

For the block 2 challenge, I'm going to use the Deck of Cards API and create a version of the game 21. 
The dealer (computer) and the player will each be dealt 2 cards. The dealer will draw again if their 
total is 11 or less. The player will choose if they draw again. After drawing, if the player total is 
over 21, they lose. The play continues until the player decides to stop. The winner is the one whose 
cards sum is closest to 21, without going over.

Possible functions/modules:

fetchJson

showCards

drawAgain

calculateTotal

newGame

For testing, the dealer’s cards & total will be shown, or at least logged in the console.

TODO:
/0 - wireframe for layout
/1 - store deck id in variable
/2 - draw card from that deck id
/3 - when card is drawn, add to a pile (of current player)
/4 - calculate total of piles
/5 - display player cards
/6 - display player total
/7 - console.log dealer's cards and total
/8 - button to draw again
9 - button to pass on draw (and initiate end of game)
10 - after every draw, check if game is over (player either goes over 21 or passes)
10b - logic for if dealer draws again
11 - when game over, display winner
11b - also display the dealer cards and total
12 - have option for a new game
13 - use CSS transitions/animations somewhere (ideas: buttons, cards)

ALSO:
- add CSS to all weeks
