    <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
    <h3>Future Functions</h3>    

    <h4>Function Properties and Methods</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>functions are first-class objects so they can have properties and methods themselves</li>
        <li>the call method can be used to set the value of this inside a functions to an object that is provided as the first argument</li>
        <li>the call and apply methods allow generalized functions to be written that are not tied to specific objects by being objects of that object</li>
        <li>memoization (caching)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>invoked as soon as it is defined</li>
        <li>the function has to be made into an expression (place the whole declaration inside parantheses
            and then place parentheses after it
        </li>
        <li>this can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn't interfere
            with any other part of the program
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>a function can also define itself and redefine itself</li>
        <li>to do so, assign an anonymous function to a variable with the same name as the function</li>
        <li>this is called the Lazy Definition Pattern</li>
        <li>can be used when some initilization is required the first time it's called</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Callbacks</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>the setTimeout method accept a callback to a function as its first parameter
            and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter
        </li>
        <li>promises simplify the callback promise</li>
        <li>when a promise is settled, you can use the then method to deal with the outcome</li>
        <li>the catch method can be used to specify what happens if it fails</li>
        <li>async functions allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous</li>
        <li>functions can return a function</li>
        <li>to use a returned function, it needs to be assigned to a variable</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Closures</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>a closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another 
            function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program
        </li>
        <li>a closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Functional Programming</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>pure functions help make functional programming more concise and predictable than in other programming styles</li>
        <li>functions should perform a single task</li>
        <li>high-order functions are functions that accept another functions as an argument, 
            or return another function as a result, or both</li>
        <li>currying is a process that involves the partial application of functions</li>
        <li>currying allows you to turn a single function into a series of functions instead</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Ajax</h3>
    <h4>The Fetch API</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>the Fetch API superseded XMLHttpRequest</li>
        <li>fetch returns a promise</li>
        <li>JSON is the most common format for AJAX responses</li>
        <li>others are text and blob</li>
        <li>you can use Headers, Request and Response Objects</li>        
    </ul>
    <h4>FormData</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>the Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to 
            submit informations in forms using Ajax
        </li>
        <li>this interface really helps when a form contains files to upload</li>
    </ul>
