        <h2>Javascript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 5 - Objects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. This means that 
                its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties and 
                methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const.
            </li>
            <li>
                Objects can inherit properties from other objects, so all objects have a method 
                called hasOwnProperty(). This can be used to check whether an object has a property 
                that is its own, rather than one that has been inherited from another object
            </li>
            <li>
                Random number, use floor() to get integer: Math.floor(n * Math.random());
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chapter 6 - The Document Object Model</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The DOM is not actually part of JavaScript because it is language agnostic 
                (although JavaScript is, by far, the language most commonly used with it). 
                This means it can be used in any programming language, not just JavaScript. 
                We can use JavaScript to access and modify different parts of a web page 
                using a special built-in object called document
            </li>
            <li>
                The replaceChild() method can be used to replace one node with another. Itâ€™s 
                called on the parent node and has two parameters: the new node and the node 
                that is to be replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any CSS property names that are separated by dashes must be written in camelCase 
                notation, so the dash is removed and the next letter is capitalized because dashes 
                are not legal characters in property names.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chapter 7 - Events</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Note that the parentheses are not placed after the function when it's used as the 
                argument to an event listener; otherwise, the function will actually be called when 
                the event listener is set, instead of when the event happens!
            </li>
            <li>
                Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called. 
                This function is automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains 
                information about the event.
            </li>
            <li>
                The target property returns a reference to the node that fired the event. 
            </li>
            <li>
                To understand the differences in these events, it is important to distinguish between 
                a physical key on the keyboard and a character that appears on the screen. The keydown 
                event is the action of pressing a key, whereas the keypress event is the action of a 
                character being typed on the screen.
            </li>
        </ul>
