        <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>    
        <h4>Strict Mode</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use strict mode - "increasing the chance of errors might seem like a bad idea at first,
            but it's much better to spot errors early on, rather than to have them cause problems later."
            </li>
            <li>
                "Writing code in strict mode can help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows 
                conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used."
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Using the Console</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The console.log() method "can be used to log the value of variables at different stages,
                although it will not actually stop the execution of the program"
            </li>
            <li>
                "The console.trace() method will log an interactice stack trace in the console. This will
                show the functions that were called in teh lead up to an exception occuring while the code
                is running."
            </li>
        </ul>
    <!--
    Am I Old Enough
    <label for="age" id="age">Am I Old Enough?</label>
    <input type="number" id="age" name="age">
    <button type="button" id="ageButton">Check Age</button>
    <span id="result"></span>
    -->
        <h4>Debugging Tools</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in
                your code that will pause it as certain points."
            </li>
            <li>
                "One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint 
                in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the 
                program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what value
                they hold at that point."
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Error Objects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                An error object can be created.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>try, catch and finally</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Testing</h4> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked.
                    Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and
                    any errors will be identified early on."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Test-driven development is considered to be best practice, but in reality you'll 
                    find most developers tend to be more pragmatic when it comes to writing tests."
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Test-driven Development</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            </ol>
