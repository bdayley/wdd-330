    <h1>Week 9</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h2>
    <h3>The Window Object</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>every javascript environment has a global object</li>       
    </ul>

    <h4>The Browser Object Model</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>the Browser Object Model is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screens</li>
        <li>JavaScript can be run in different environments; the BOM only makes sense in a browser environment</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Document Object</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer</li>
        <li>the document.cookie property acts like a speical type of string</li>
        <li>assigning another cookie to it won't overwrite the entire property, it will append it to the end of the string</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Timing Functions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the exectuion of a function, 
            and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.</li>
        <li>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter
            and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
        </li>
        <li>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way, except it repeatedly invokes the 
            callback function every given number of milliseconds.
        </li>
        <li>Be careful using this with either method, as the binding of this is set to the window object,
            rather than the method's object.
        </li>
        <li>setTimeout() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements of a webpage</li>
        <div id="square"></div>
        <li>requestAnimationFrame makes it smoother</li>
        <div id="square2"></div>
        <li>Generally it is better to use CSS for any animation effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
    <h4>The data- Attribute</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignoted by the browser.</li>
        <li>They're also private to the page. They're sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
        <li>If a data- attribute's name contains hyphens, they are replaced with camel-case notation (data-max-lenghth -> dataset.maxLength)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Other API's</h4>
